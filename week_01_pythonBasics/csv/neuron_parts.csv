Name,Function
Dendrites,"Dendrites are branch-like structures extending away from the cell body, and their job is to receive messages from other neurons and allow those messages to travel to the cell body."
Cell Body,"Like other cells, each neuron has a cell body (or soma) that contains a nucleus, smooth and rough endoplasmic reticulum, Golgi apparatus, mitochondria, and other cellular components."
Axon,"An axon, at its most basic, is a tube-like structure that carries an electrical impulse from the cell body"
Synapse,The synapse is the chemical junction between the axon terminals of one neuron and the dendrites of the next.
Myelin Sheath,An external coating that functions as insulation to minimize dissipation of the electrical signal as it travels down the axon.
